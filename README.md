!!!IMPORTANT!!!
please remember that you have to run create table/database command only once. So in case you have run the command once in this python code and u need to run the code again, please comment the create table execute command to avoid errors. Likewise any alterations which affect the database are to be noted and informed via commit comment or in person, or in this readme in the format: NAME-DATE-COMMIT added.... to avoid confusions.

please replace the host, user and password with your own localhost database for testing



HAPPY CODING :)
